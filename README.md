## Project Overview

The Game-Inventory-Management project focuses on creating a flexible and extensible inventory management system for games. By incorporating concepts from modern financial markets, the project aims to provide game developers with advanced inventory management capabilities.

The project follows the principles of Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture) to decouple the core business logic from external dependencies. It employs CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for separating read and write operations, enabling optimized handling of complex inventory operations.

## Package Structure

The project's codebase is organized into the following package structure:

- `cmd/`
- `internal/`
  - `domain/`
  - `application/`
  - `ports/`
  - `adapters/`
- `scripts/`
- `test/`

## Technologies Used

The Game-Inventory-Management project utilizes the following technologies:

1. **Go (Golang):** The project is implemented using the Go programming language, which provides a strong type system, efficient concurrency, and extensive standard libraries.
2. **Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture):** The project follows the Ports and Adapters architectural pattern, also known as Hexagonal Architecture, to achieve loose coupling and separation of concerns.
3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** CQRS is employed to separate the read and write operations, enabling optimized handling of complex inventory operations and improving scalability.
4. **PostgreSQL:** The project uses PostgreSQL as the relational database management system for persisting inventory and related data.
5. **Echo Framework:** Echo is used as the web framework for building the HTTP API endpoints, providing routing, middleware, and request handling capabilities.
6. **Microservices:** The project architecture is designed to support a microservices-based approach, allowing for the scalability and independence of different inventory services.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Game-Inventory-Management project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-inventory-management.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager.
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database and update the application configuration accordingly.
4. Run the database migrations to set up the required database schema.
5. Start the application using the provided entry points, such as running the server or executing specific commands.
